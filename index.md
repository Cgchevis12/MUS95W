## Describe Raga in as much detail as you can: 

Indian classical music uses ragas, a melodic framework, for both composition and improvisation.
A Raga has its own set of notes (swaras), which make up the melodic structure, and its own set of guidelines for movements
that are both ascending and descending (aaroha and avroha). In order to define the mood and feeling of the Raga, each Raga
also contains a dominant note (vadi) and a secondary note (samvadi). Ragas can elicit feelings such as joy, grief, love,
or devotion. They are frequently connected with certain times of day, seasons, or moods.

## In 3-5 sentences, describe Tala:

The rhythmic framework known as tala in Indian classical music gives compositions and improvisations a structure.
It consists of a series of beats that are grouped together into groupings called vibhags or angas and distinguished
by certain hand motions or claps. Each beat in a tala, which has a set number of beats, is denoted by a syllable, 
such as "dha," "din," or "ta." The melodic line is supported by the rhythmic pattern, which is repeated repeatedly throughout the performance.

## What are the four stages in the development of a Raga:

a) Alap:The artist explores the sounds and emotion of the Raga in the alap, a quiet, contemplative, and improvisational introduction to the Raga.
b) Jor: An extension of the Raga's rhythm, yet without the Tala, in which the performer adds a pulse and improvises utilizing the melodic lines unique to the Raga.
c) Gat or Bandish: A predetermined composition where the Tala is introduced and the performer starts weaving melodic patterns while maintaining the rhythmic cycle.
d) Taan: A quick, virtuoso passage when the musician improvises using intricate, quick melodic phrases to show off their technical proficiency and originality.

## Describe what you witnessed during the March 17th presentation you attended of Zakir Hussain:

There are several memorable moments during the occurrences. But the thing that most deeply affects me 
is how flexible Zakir Hussain's finger is when he plays the tala, performing the song in the traditional method.
Also, he could produce noises with his mouse and repeat them with tala! amazing! It combines traditional and contemporary fashion.
He demonstrated the allure of tala with his dance to the crowd.
